## What is a DeCo?

A DeCo is an organization that operates in a decentralized manner, leveraging blockchain technology for its governance, finances, and rewards. Unlike traditional companies where value is centralized among a few, in a DeCo, value is distributed among those who truly build and contribute.

In a DeCo:

* **Open Collaboration:** Individuals from diverse disciplines (developers, lawyers, marketers, accountants, designers) contribute documents, strategies, analyses, and code to a public repository.
* **Value in Contributions:** Every `commit` and positive `reaction` to a contribution automatically generates the DeCo's own tokens, incentivizing active and quality participation.
* **Full Transparency:** All decisions and transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
* **AI Assistance:** Specialized Artificial Intelligence agents accelerate initial work, generating drafts and analyses that human experts can refine.
* **Self-Sustaining Economy:** Each DeCo generates its own token, whose value is directly linked to its success and the inflow of external capital into its projects.
