# Configuration for Contribution Values in a DeCo
# This file defines how many tokens are generated for different types of contributions
# and how the contributor's role and reactions affect the value.
#
# Columns:
# contribution_type: The type of activity (commit, pull_request, issue_report, suggestion, reaction_...)
# role: The role of the contributor (maintainer, contributor, non_member)
# base_value: The base value of the contribution in the DeCo's native token.
# member_reaction_multiplier: Multiplier if the reaction is from a DeCo member.
# non_member_reaction_multiplier: Multiplier if the reaction is from a NON-member of the DeCo.
#
# Notes:
# - "Reactions" here refer to reactions on commits, PRs, issues, etc.
# - The oracle will sum the base_value and apply the reaction multipliers for each reaction.
# - Reactions themselves can have their own types (e.g., reaction_heart, reaction_thumbs_up)
#   which could have different base_values and multipliers if more granular weights are desired.

# --- Reactions (to content/code/documents) ---
# The 'base_value' for an individual reaction is typically low or zero,
# and the real value comes from the 'multiplier' applied to the 'base_value' of the reacted-to item.
# However, for simplicity or to give direct value to a reaction, we can provide a base_value.
# Optional: You could have the oracle only sum the multipliers to the original commit/PR value.
# For this draft, we'll give them a small base value and multipliers.
